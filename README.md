# Cell_Simulation
Cell_Simulation is a small software aime to simulate different type of cell population (biological cell, ants...).

I would like to implements a lot of different behaviors and maybe one day simulate natural selectivity.

If you are interested by that, do not hesitate to contribute !

# Behavior already implements
- John Conway's Life game
- Langton's Ant simultation
